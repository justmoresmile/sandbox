    Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript
    We can also multiply one number by another.
    
    JavaScript uses the * symbol for multiplication of two numbers.
    
    Example
    
    const myVar = 13 * 13;
    myVar would have the value 169.
    
    Change the 0 so that product will equal 80.
