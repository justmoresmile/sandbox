    Add Two Numbers with JavaScript
    Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.
    
    Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.
    
    JavaScript uses the + symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.
    
    Example:
    
    const myVar = 5 + 10;
    myVar now has the value 15.
    
    Change the 0 so that sum will equal 20.
