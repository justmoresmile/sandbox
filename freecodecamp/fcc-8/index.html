    Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
    In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.
    
    Example
    
    'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'
    Note: Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.
    
    Example:
    
    const ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";
    The string I come first. I come second. would be displayed in the console.
    
    Build myStr from the strings This is the start. and This is the end. using the + operator. Be sure to include a space between the two strings.
